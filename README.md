👋 Hi, I’m @Ammar434
<br>
<br>
👀 I’m interested in high-performance computing, quantum computing, and distributed systems. I'm passionate about creating innovative mobile applications, VR/MR applications and exploring new technologies that push the boundaries of digital interaction.
<br>
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, Java, C, and Ocaml. I'm deeply engaged in understanding and developing applications with Flutter, and working on complex algorithms in C and Java.
<br>
<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on mobile development, particularly with Flutter, or any initiatives involving advanced computing systems or algorithm development.
