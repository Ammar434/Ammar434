👋 Hi, I’m @Ammar434
<br\>
👀 I’m interested in high-performance computing, quantum computing, and distributed systems. I'm passionate about creating innovative mobile applications and exploring new technologies that push the boundaries of digital interaction.
🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, Java, C, and Ocaml. I'm deeply engaged in understanding and developing applications with Flutter, and working on complex algorithms in C and Java.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on mobile development, particularly with Flutter, or any initiatives involving advanced computing systems or algorithm development. I am also interested in contributing to educational projects that aim to simplify technology for a broader audience.
